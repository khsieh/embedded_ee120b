* Assignment: Lab #1 Exercise #7
* Exercise Description: An amusement park kid ride cart has three seats, with 8-bit weight sensors
* connected to ports A, B, and C (measuring from 0-255 kilograms). Set PD0 to 1 if
* the cart's total passenger weight exceeds the maximum of 140 kg. Also, the cart
* must be balanced: Set port PD1 to 1 if the difference between A and C exceeds 80
* kg. Can you also devise a way to inform the ride operator of the approximate
* weight using the remaining bits on D? 
*
* I acknowledge all content contained herein, excluding template or example
* code, is my own original work.
